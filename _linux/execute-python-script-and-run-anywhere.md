## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to execute a Python script! Moreover, you'll learn how to run a script from anywhere in the Terminal, regardless of its type (Python, bash, ...). Which means you don't have to care about where the script is placed and what is your *current working directory*. 

## Create the script
Assimung you want to place your script inside `my_scripts` Documents' subfolder (which does not exist jet), let's open a new Terminal window and type:
```bash
# Create the directory
mkdir Documents/my_scripts

# Move inside the directory
cd Documents/my_scripts/

# Create the Python script
touch hello.py

# Edit the script
nano hello.py
```

The above lines that starts with `#` symbol, are comments I wrote just to clarify what I did.<br>
Let's update the script content with the code I wrote below:
```python                                            
#!/bin/usr/python3


def say_hello():
        name = input('What\'s you name? ')
        if name != '':
                print('Hello {}!'.format(name))
        else:
                print('Hello World!')

say_hello()

```

## Add the execute permissions
If you type the `ls -l` command, you'll see the **string permission** (together with some useful info) foreach file in the current directory. For `hello.py`, it should looks like:
```bash
-rw-rw-r--
```

As you can read in my article about [changing permission to a file](https://pitpietro.github.io/linux/change-permission-to-files/), `-rw-rw-r--` means:
1. `hello.py` is a file (the starting `-` symbol)
2. The current user has `read` and `write` permission: `rw-`
3. The user's group has `read` and `write` permission: `rw-`
4. Other users (outside the user's group) have `read` permission only: `r--`
<br>

**Please Note**: *user* and *user group* could have the same name: take care not to confuse them!<br><br>

Let's add execute permission to the *user* and *user group*:
```bash
chmod 774 hello.py
```

Run again the `ls -l` command and analize the new **string permission** that should now look like: `-rwxrwxr--`
1. `hello.py` is a file (the starting `-` symbol)
2. The current user has `read`, `write` and `execute` permission: `rwx`
3. The user's group has `read`, `write` and `execute` permission: `rwx`
4. Other users (outside the user's group) have `read` permission only: `r--`
<br>

**Please Note**: `chmod` provides the easy-to-remember flag `+x`.<br>
It gives `execute` permission even to the users outside the file owner's group:
```bash
# Those lines are equivalent
chmod +x hello.py
chmod 775 hello.py
```

Feel free to use the right **string permission**, that best suits for your purposes.

## Run the script from the terminal
Here you are! Let's type:
```bash
python3 ./hello.py
```

And get as output:
```
What's your name?
```

Type your name or just a name, for example `Bob` and get the result:
```
Hello Bob!
```

Allowing an interaction with the end-user, the output will always change! Moreover, if you do not insert any name and simply press `Enter` when the program asks for your name, it will print:
```
Hello World!
```

**Please Note**: When you run the script from the Terminal, `./` tells the shell to look for your script (in ths case `hello.py`) in the current working directory.

## Add the folder to PATH environmental variable
To allow you to run the script from anywhere in the Terminal, you need to add `my_scripts` to `$PATH`  environmental variable.<br>
As you can read [here](https://pitpietro.github.io/linux/envronmental-variables-and-status-commands/#path), `$PATH` lists all the folders that contain executable scripts.<br>
Depending on the shell you have installed on your distro, you have to modify a different file to add `my_scripts`'s path to `$PATH`. I suggest you to read [create custom env var](https://pitpietro.github.io/linux/envronmental-variables-and-status-commands/#create-a-custom-env-var) slice of my previous tutorial to find out the file you have to modify.<br>
Since I am using Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS, Iâ€™ll refer to `.bashrc` file.
```bash
nano .bashrc
```

Scroll down to the end of the file and type:<br>
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/Documents/my_scripts
```

Hit `Ctrl + X` to exit and `Y` to save its content.<br>
Close and open again a Terminal window to allow the changes to take effect, you now can run:
```bash
hello.py
```

You can also run any script placed in `my_scripts` from anywhere in your PC! (Off course you must change its permissions).<br>

**Please Note**: To call the script, just type `hello.py` without the starting `./` since you're no loger in its directory.

## Add the alias to "remove" the extension
If you are tired of having to call `hello.py` with its extension (`.py`), you can use an *alias* to remove it!<br>
Open again `.bashrc` file with `nano .bashrc`, scroll down to the end of the file and type:
```bash
alias hello='hello.py'
```

Hit `Ctrl + X` to exit and `Y` to save its content.<br><br>
Close and open again a Terminal window, now you can run `hello` script from anywhere in your PC!
