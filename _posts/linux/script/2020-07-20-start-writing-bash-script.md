## Introduction

## Writes and runs the script
Open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` and change directory to Documents, create a new folder with `mkdir script_folder` and jump right into it with `cd script_folder`. Create a file with `touch script1.sh` and edit it using the nano terminal text editor: `nano script1.sh`.
```
ls
pwd
pushd .
cd ~
pwd
popd
```

Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor and `Ctrl + Y` to save the changes.
To run the script, type `./script1.sh` and see the result.
