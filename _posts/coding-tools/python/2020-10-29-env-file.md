## Introduction
Say you want to publish a Python project on GitHub, GitLab (or others web-based DevOps lifecycle tools) but some of your scripts contains sensitive info (i.e. login credential, birthday dates, credit card numbers). The easiest and worst solution is to make the repository *private*.<br>
Let's find out how to protect your info and safely publish your repo online!

## Install the .env library
I suggest you to use Python3 instead of Python2 since Python4 will soon released.<br>
Install pip for Python3
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Install **python-dotenv** library
```bash
pip install -U python-dotenv
```

## Save info on .env file
Open a Terminal window and reach the folder where your python script is, the create the file:
```bash
nano .env
```

And write something like:
```bash
LOCAL_IP='192.168.0.47'
```
Then press **Ctrl + X** and **Y** to save the file and exit.

## Allow the script to reach .env
Inside the python script, you need to specify where the `.env` file is:
```python
import os
import sys
from os.path import join, dirname
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# place other imports here

dotenv_path = join(dirname(__file__), '.env')
load_dotenv(dotenv_path)

my_ip = os.environ.get('LOCAL_IP')

print('My local IP is: ', my_ip)
```

Say you named your script `print_env.py`, you can then run the script with:
```bash
python3 print_env.py
```

## Conclusion
Here we are, is was easy, isn't it?<br>
The last thing you need to remember before closing this page is that a well written `.gitignore` will not push your `.env` files online (otherwise it will be useless to store sensitive info on them). So, if you work on different machines, you'll need to create a `.env` file foreach of them.
