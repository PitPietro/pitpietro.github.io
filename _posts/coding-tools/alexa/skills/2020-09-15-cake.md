## 0 ~ Introduction
The **Cake Day** skill asks the user for his birthday, remember it and wishes him *Happy Birthday*. Moreover, the skill can tell how many days are left to his birthday.<br>
**Please Note**: I am referencing to an open source project I mention in the [reference](#reference) slice of this post. I don't want to steal someone-else work.<br>
The original project name was **Cake Time**, I changed it to **Cake Day** in honor of [reddit](https://reddit.com)'s cake day!

## 1 ~ Setting up the project
Open a browser page at [amazon alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa), click on the tree dots menu on the upper right and press on **Alexa Developer Console**.<br>
Click on the blue button "Create Skill" and set the next steps as below:
- **Skill name**: Cake Day
- **Default language**: English (US)
- **1. Choose a model to add to your skill**: Custom
- **2. Choose a method to host your skill's backend resources**: Alexa-Hosted (Python)
Moreover, in the upper right, I do select *EU (Ireland)* as **Hosting Region** since I am an European citizen. You can now press on `Create Skill` blue button (again).
- **Choose a template to add to your skill**: Hello World Skill
Press on "Continue with template" blue button and wait fot the skill to b created.
***
The project should open on the **Build** tab. Press on the `Invocation` slice in the left (under "`CUSTOM`"). Change the **Skill Invocation Name** to *cake day*. Press on `Save Model` and then `Build Model` on the top of the screen.<br>
[cake 1]

### 1a ~ Modify the LaunchRequestHandler
The first thing you can do to see your skill in action is switching to **Code** tab and open *lamda_functions.py*.<br>
Once you get here, look for `class LaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):`<br>
Inside the `handle(...)` function, modify the `speak_out` variable; in the return statement, comment out the `.ask(speak_output)` line. It should became something like this:
```python
class LaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    """Handler for Skill Launch."""
    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        # type: (HandlerInput) -> bool

        return ask_utils.is_request_type("LaunchRequest")(handler_input)

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        # type: (HandlerInput) -> Response
        speak_output = "Welcome to Cake Day!"

        return (
            handler_input.response_builder
                .speak(speak_output)
                # .ask(speak_output)
                .response
        )
```
Press on `Save` and then `Deploy` on the upper right. Once the project is deployed successfully, press on the **Test** tab and change the upper left selector, which should be on *Off*, to *Development*.<br>
In the text box alongside the current language, for me *English (US)*, type `open cake day` and the output will be the content of `speak_out` variable: "Welcome to Cake Day!".
[cake_2]

## 2 ~ Collect slots turn-by-turn with auto-delegation
### 2a ~ Ask the user for his birthday
Once again you need to modify the `speak_out` variable inside the `LaunchRequestHandler(...)` class. The skill have to ask the user for his birthday, so let's update the code:
```python
speak_output = "Welcome to Cake Day! May I ask you when is your birthday?"
```
Moreover, to allow the skill to listen for the response, you have to uncomment the `.ask(speak_output)` line inside the return statement of `handle(...)` method. The `.ask()` function basically does two things:
1. tells the skill to wait for the user to reply
2. allows you to specify a method to ask the question again (if the user doesn't respond)

Add the `reprompt_text` variable in the `handle()` function:
```python
reprompt_text = "I was born Nov. 6th, 2014. Please, tell me when are you born?"
```
**Best Practices**:
1. Make the `reprompt` text different from the initial speech text.
2. Use `reprompt` to give the user an example of what the skill expects the user to say.

**Please Note**: You can use *Speech Synthesis Markup Language* (SSML) to have Alexa read "2014."<br>
Pass `reprompt_text` to the `.ask()` function: in the return statement of `handle()` function, replace `.ask(speak_output)` with `.ask(reprompt_text)`.<br>
Now, the `LaunchRequestHandler` should look like:
```python
class LaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    """Handler for Skill Launch."""
    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        # type: (HandlerInput) -> bool

        return ask_utils.is_request_type("LaunchRequest")(handler_input)

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        # type: (HandlerInput) -> Response
        speak_output = "Welcome to Cake Day! May I ask you when is your birthday?"
        reprompt_text = "I was born Nov. 6th, 2014. Please, tell me when are you born?"
        return (
            handler_input.response_builder
                .speak(speak_output)
                .ask(reprompt_text)
                .response
        )
```
**Best Practice**: Every time you make some change to the code, remind yourself to `Save` and `Deploy` the project with the upper right buttons.<br> 
[cake_3]

### 2b ~ Use intent and slots to catch information
You now need to create an *intent* that will solve how the user reply to Alexa's question. Since the intent have to capture the user's birthday, let's name it **CaptureBirthdayIntent** following the camel case convention.

#### 2ba ~ Add a new custom intent
Press on the **Build** tab, on `Interaction Model` and then on the `Intents` slice in the left (all under "`CUSTOM`"). It will open a new session on the right, press the `+ Add Intent` button, type the name in the text box that will appear and than on `Create custom intent`. 

#### 2bb ~ Add an Utterance
You need to create the *utterance* that will invoke the *intent*. Moreover, you need to add a *slot* for each pieces of information to collect: the month, the day and the year.<br>
Press again on `Intents`, then on your **CaptureBirthdayIntent** intent. It will load a page where you can add **Sample Utterances**.<br>
Let's use a sample utterance like this one: *I was born on December tenth, nineteen ninety-two*. In this example, the user is born on 10/12/1992 (using *DD/MM/YYYY* as date format). So let's add this statement in the text box and press on the `+` sign on the right.<br>
There are two ways for creating a slot, select the word in the sample utterance:

1. Where the slot should go and type the name of the slot in curly brackets (for example, *{day}* in place of *tenth*).
2. And use the **Select an Existing Slot** dialog box when it appears. In the dialog box, click the field under **Create a new slot**, type the name of the slot without curly brackets (for example, *month*), and click `Add`.

Replace the month, the day and the year so that the utterance will become: *I was born on {month} {day} {year}*. Also add some new utterances:
```
{month} {day}
{month} {day} {year}
{month} {year}
I was born on {month} {day}
I was born on {month} {day} {year}
I was born in {month} {year}
```

#### 2bc ~ Add the slot type to the slots
Slots, like variables in any programming languages, have a *type*. There are two slot types: custom and built-in (the once how starts with *AMAZON.*). Always choose the built-in types if possible.

So let's scroll down the page to **Intent Slots**. Select `AMAZON.Month` from the **Slot Type** drop-down menu on the right of *month* slot. While for *day* slot, select `AMAZON.Ordinal` and for *year* slot, select `AMAZON.FOUR_DIGIT_NUMBER` as the slot type.<br>
Scroll up to the top of the page and press on `Save Model`.

[cake_4]

### 2c ~ Use dialog management
Slots can be:
1. required: Alexa will hardly work to fill it
2. optional

Since we need the day, the month and the year of the user, those slots must all be *required*. You can label a slot as *required* by using the **dialog management**.<br>
Scroll down th page to the **Intent Slots** section and press on the *month* slot on the right, then click on `Edit Dialog`. Under the `Slot Filling` title, activate the toggle entitled `Is this slot required to fulfill the intent?` so that the `Alexa speech prompts` field will appear: type *Sorry, can you please repeat me what month were you born in?* and press `Enter` on the keyboard to save the text-box's content.<br>
Click on a **CaptureBirthdayIntent**'s slot name in the left-hand panel to change screen and repeat the process for *day* and *year* slots (changing the questions accordingly to the slot's meaning).

[cake_5]

Moreover, you need to delete the `HelloWorldIntent` in the left-hand pane. Click on `Intents` and and press on `Delete` (under **ACTIONS**) on the right of `HelloWorldIntent`.

### 2d ~ Define an handler
Click on the **Code** tab. The *lamda_functions.py* file should be open here. Find the `HelloWorldIntentHandler` class and rename it `CaptureBirthdayIntentHandler` (remind yourself to rename also the class call at the end of the file), then modify the class to look as below:
```python
class CaptureBirthdayIntentHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        return ask_utils.is_intent_name("CaptureBirthdayIntent")(handler_input)

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        slots = handler_input.request_envelope.request.intent.slots
        year = slots["year"].value
        month = slots["month"].value
        day = slots["day"].value
        
        # the skill will confirm to the user that their birthday was heard correctly
        speak_output = 'Thank you, I will remember that you were born {month} {day} {year}.'.format(month=month, day=day, year=year)

        return (
            handler_input.response_builder
                .speak(speak_output)
                .response
        )
```

`Save` and `Deploy`, then switch to **Test** tab to test the skill.<br>

## 3 ~ Make the skill able to save information
So far, the skill is able to ask for the user's birthday but it does not really save any information: the next time the user will trigger the skill, he will have to tell his birthday again.

### 3a ~ Amazon S3
Let's use **Amazon S3** to solve the memorization problem: the skill can read the information from session to session. Moreover, the SDK provide the **AttributesManager**: the read/write code can remain the same, even if you change the location of your saved data.<br>

#### 3aa ~ Add the AttributesManager dependency
Click on the **Code** tab, open the *requirements.txt* file and add this line of code:
```
ask-sdk-s3-persistence-adapter
```

`Save` the file.<br>
This new dependency allows you to use the **AttributesManager**, so let's import it into the code. In the *lamda_functions.py*, find the `import ask_sdk_core.utils as ask_utils` line, press `Enter` to add a new line and write this code below:

```python
import os
from ask_sdk_s3.adapter import S3Adapter
s3_adapter = S3Adapter(bucket_name=os.environ["S3_PERSISTENCE_BUCKET"])
```

#### 3ab ~ Replace the skill builder
The import: `from ask_sdk_core.skill_builder import SkillBuilder` became:
```python
from ask_sdk_core.skill_builder import CustomSkillBuilder
```

And the initialization `sb = SkillBuilder()` became:
```python
sb = CustomSkillBuilder(persistence_adapter=s3_adapter)
```

Once again, `Save` and `Deploy`.

### 3b ~ Save data
Look for the `handle()` function inside the `CaptureBirthdayIntentHandler` class, right before the `speak_output` variable, add the code below:
```python
attributes_manager = handler_input.attributes_manager

birthday_attributes = {
    "year": year,
    "month": month,
    "day": day
}

attributes_manager.persistent_attributes = birthday_attributes
attributes_manager.save_persistent_attributes()
```

The `birthday_attributes` maps the variables already declared above in the function to the corresponding variables that will be created in Amazon S3.

Once again, `Save` and `Deploy`.

### 3c ~ Read stored data
The skill must read the data stored in the Amazon S3 before asking the user for his birthday: it will the ask the user for the information only if there is no data on the Amazon S3. So let's add a new *handler* class, right before the **CaptureBirthdayIntentHandler** class:
```python

class HasBirthdayLaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        # extract persistent attributes and check if they are all present
        attr = handler_input.attributes_manager.persistent_attributes
        attributes_are_present = ("year" in attr and "month" in attr and "day" in attr)

        return attributes_are_present and ask_utils.is_request_type("LaunchRequest")(handler_input)

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        attr = handler_input.attributes_manager.persistent_attributes
        year = attr['year']
        month = attr['month'] # month is a string --> convert it to a month index later
        day = attr['day']

        # TODO:: Use the settings API to get current date and then compute how many days until user’s bday
        # TODO:: Say happy birthday on the user’s birthday

        speak_output = "Welcome back it looks like there are X more days until your y-th birthday."
        handler_input.response_builder.speak(speak_output)

        return handler_input.response_builder.response
```

Let's add a request handler before `sb.add_request_handler(LaunchRequestHandler())`:
```python
sb.add_request_handler(HasBirthdayLaunchRequestHandler())
```

`Save` and `Deploy`.

[cake_6]

Right now, when you open your skill for the second time, you get a response with some placeholders. Let's find out how to fill them all!<br>

### 3d ~ Delete or reset stored data
Since you're testing the skill, you may need to delete the collected information.
Press on the **Code** tab and press on **Media Storage: S3** in the bottom left: it will open the **S3 Management Console**:
- On the top of the page, click on the link places after `Amazon S3 > ` (lots of numbers, letters and some dashes)
- Click on the `Action` drop-down menu
- Scroll down and click `Delete`
- Confirm and press `Delete` again

[cake_7]

## 4 ~ Use the Alexa Settings API
You can now enable the skill to calculate the number of days until the next user's birthday. To do so, you'll need some information that will be provided by the *Alexa Settings API*, such as the time zone and the current date. You cannot ask those questions to the user because this would cause a loss of fluidity in the dialogue.<br>
To get the additional information, you need to pass those data to the Alexa Settings API:
1. Device ID
2. API Endpoint: Alexa Settings API
3. Access Token: Alexa Settings API

### 4a ~ Get information for Alexa Settings API
In this section, you'll be able to collect the info described above.<br>
The *device ID* is provided in all the request that comes to the skill code. You'll traverse the request object to get the *device ID* using the **requestEnvelope**: `handlerInput.requestEnvelope.context.System.device.deviceId`.<br>
You can also use the SDK's utility function: `device_id = ask_sdk_core.utils.request_util.get_device_id(handler_input)`.<br>
Here is a link to the [SDK General Utilities](https://alexa-skills-kit-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/core.html#module-ask_sdk_core.utils.predicate)<br>
Open the *requirements.txt* file in the **Code** tab and add this line at the end of the file:
```
pytz
```
Then open *lamda_functions.py*, find the `HasBirthdayLaunchRequestHandler` class and update the `handle` function as below:

```python
class HasBirthdayLaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        ...

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        attr = handler_input.attributes_manager.persistent_attributes
        year = attr['year']
        month = attr['month'] # month is a string --> convert it to a month index later
        day = attr['day']

        # get devce ID
        sys_object = handler_input.request_envelope.context.system
        device_id = sys_object.device_id
        
        # get Alexa Settings API Info
        api_endpoint = sys_object.api_endpoint
        api_access_token = sys_object.api_access_token
        
        # TODO:: ...
        # TODO:: ...

        speak_output = "Welcome back it looks like there are X more days until your y-th birthday."
        handler_input.response_builder.speak(speak_output)

        return handler_input.response_builder.response
```

### 4b ~ Use the Alexa Settings API to get the user time zone
Update the `HasBirthdayLaunchRequestHandler` class as below:
```python
class HasBirthdayLaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        ...

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        attr = handler_input.attributes_manager.persistent_attributes
        year = attr['year']
        month = attr['month'] # month is a string --> convert it to a month index later
        day = attr['day']

        # get devce ID
        sys_object = handler_input.request_envelope.context.system
        device_id = sys_object.device_id
        
        # get Alexa Settings API Info
        api_endpoint = sys_object.api_endpoint
        api_access_token = sys_object.api_access_token
        
        # construct systems api timezone url
        url = '{api_endpoint}/v2/devices/{device_id}/settings/System.timeZone'.format(api_endpoint=api_endpoint, device_id=device_id)
        headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer' + api_access_token}
        
        userTimeZone = ""
        try:
            req = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            res = req.json()
            logger.info("Device API result: {}".format(str(res)))
            userTimeZone = res
        except Exception:
            handler_input.response_builder.speak("Ops... There was a problem when trying to connecting to the service")
            return handler_input.response_builder.response
        
        # TODO:: ...
        # TODO:: ...

        speak_output = "Welcome back it looks like there are X more days until your y-th birthday."
        handler_input.response_builder.speak(speak_output)

        return handler_input.response_builder.response
```

### 4c ~ Get the current date & extract day, month and year
Add the following lines on the top of *lamda_functions.py* file (right after `import os`):
```python
import requests
import calendar
from datetime import datetime
from pytz import timezone
```

Let's get the current date and time (e.g. 10/06/2020 18:30 using *DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm* as format) according to the user's timezone. But those information are now provided in seconds, so let's convert it  
You can now replace the 1st **TODO** with the lines:
```python
# getting the current date with the time
now_time = datetime.now(timezone(userTimeZone))

# Removing the time from the date because it affects our difference calculation
now_date = datetime(now_time.year, now_time.month, now_time.day)
current_year = now_time.year
```

`Save` the project!<br>

### 4d ~ Determine the user's next birthday
The skill need to determinate the user's next birthday:
1. combine the year and the month of the birthday with the current year
2. determinte if the birthday has passed this calendar year
Add those lines after the once written before:
```python
# get the next birthday
month_as_index = list(calendar.month_abbr).index(month[:3].title())
next_birthday = datetime(current_year, month_as_index, day)
```

You also need to cast *year* and *day* on the top of the class, so replace those lines:
```python
year = attr['year']
month = attr['month'] # ...
day = attr['day']
```

With those ones:
```python
year = int(attr['year'])
month = attr['month'] # ...
day = int(attr['day'])
```

### 4e ~ Compute difference between current date and user's next birthday
The skill now needs:
1. convert each date into *Unix epoch time*
   It's the seconds spent since the midnight of January 1st, 1970 UTC minus *leap seconds*.
2. evaluate the difference between the *current date* and the *birthday date* in milliseconds (ms)
3. take the absolute value of the difference
4. convert the difference from milliseconds to days
**Please Note**: 1 day in ms is equal to 24 hours $\cdot$ 60 min $\cdot$ 60 sec $\cdot$ 1000 ms<br>

Let's replace the `speak_out` variable (remove the **TODO**) with those lines of code:
```python
# check if the bday, for this year, is already gone
if now_date > next_birthday:
    next_birthday = datetime(
        current_year + 1,
        month_as_index,
        day
    )
    current_year += 1

# setting the default speak_output to Happy xth Birthday!!
# Alexa will automatically correct the ordinal for you.
# no need to worry about when to use st, th, rd
        
if now_date != next_birthday:
    diff_days = abs((now_date - next_birthday).days)
    speak_output = "Welcome back. It looks like there are {days} days until your {birthday_num}th birthday"
    .format(
        days=diff_days,
        birthday_num=(current_year-year)
    )

```
