## Introduction
In this introductive post, I'll talk about the *gpio zero* Python library for Raspberry PI devices. It uses the **General Purpuse Input Output** feature to control the Raspberry PI's pins as inputs and outputs.<br>
Moreover, I'll add some grafic user interfaces (GUIs) written in **PyQt5** to let you create good-looking and usefull contents.

## 1. Install the libraries
### 1.1 Install GPIO Zero
Run the following commands on the terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gopiozero
```
**OR**
```bash
sudo pip3 install gpiozero
```
Based on the OS of your Raspberry PI.<br>
You can also install the library on a Linux/Mac operative system, but I won't cover this argument here: please visit [Configuring Remote GPIO](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/remote_gpio.html) page for more information.

### 1.2. Install PyQt5
```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo pip3 install PyQt5
```

## 2. Basics
### 2.1. Import the library
Say you need the `LED` object in your Python script (one of the most common), you'll need this line of code on the top of your import statements:
```python
from gpiozero import LED
```

From now on, you can instantiate a `LED` object inside a variable:
```python
my_led = LED(17)
```

You can also import the whole library:
```python
import gpiozero
```

But you'll then have to call objects in this way:
```python
my_led = gpiozero.LED(17)
```

### 2.2. Pin Numbering

You can also use this command to prints out the pins number and the related GPIO pins:
```bash
pinouts
```

The *gpiozero* library uses the BCM (Broadcom) pn numbering for the GPIO pins.<br>

**Please Note:** If you want to connect a LED on pin GPIO 17, you need to wire-up the physical pin 11 on the Raspberry PI board.<br>

If you want to use the physical numbering (BOARD) you have to specify the pin number as `BOARD11`. You can also use other ways to call a specific pin,he following lines are all equivalent:
```python
>>> led = LED("GPIO17")
>>> led = LED("BCM17")
>>> led = LED("BOARD11")
>>> led = LED("WPI0")
>>> led = LED("J8:11")
```

Since these alterante schemes are nothing more than translations, if you request the state of a device on the command line, the associated pin number will always be reported in the Broadcom (BCM) scheme:
```python
>>> my_led
<gpiozero.LED object on pin GPIO17, active_high=True, is_active=False>
```

### 2.3. LED
