## Introduction
It's very important to know how to read an *analog input* value from the Arduino board, so that this can then trigger the implementation of an output.<br>
In this post, you'll use a potentiometer just to print its value on the console. In the next post you'll use the potentiometer to light-up a green led when the value is 1 and a red led when the value is 0.<br>
Just for now, let's keep simple!

## Hardware requirement
1. Arduino board
2. [Potentiometer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/potentiometer) (I use a 10k ohm)
3. Hook-up wires of different colors
4. Breadboard
