## Introduction
I used Arduino printed circuit board the first years of high school, then I left it closed in a drawer for several years. A few months ago I started studying Python and I discovered that it is possible to program an Arduino through this very versatile language. In today's blog, you'll simply *blink* a LED, but that's where it all starts!

## Hardware requirement
1. Arduino board
2. LED (of any color)
3. 220 ohm resistor <span>&#177;</span>5% (red - red - brown - gold)
4. Breadboard & wires (of different colors)

## Hardware setup
Connect a black wire to the side of the breadboard (the once near the blue/black line).<br>
Connect one side of the resistor where you put the wire before and the other side of the resistor in an arbitrarily decided center line.<br>
The LED has two legs:
1. the longer leg is positive
2. the shorter leg is negative
Connect the negative leg to the resistor (using the breadboard).<br>
Connet the positive leg to a wire that points to PIN 13.

**Please Note**: You can choose the pin you want, but you need to be sure to change the code accordingly.<br>
