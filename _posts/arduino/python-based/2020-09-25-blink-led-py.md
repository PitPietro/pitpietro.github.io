## Introduction
Have you ever wondered if it is possible to program an Arduino with a programming language other than C?<br>
**Python** is the answer! In today's blog, you'll *blink* a LED using the *pyFirmata* library.

## Hardware requirement
1. Arduino board
2. LED (of any color)
3. 220 ohm resistor <span>&#177;</span>5% (red - red - brown - gold)
4. Breadboard & wires (of different colors)

## Hardware setup
Connect a black wire to the side of the breadboard (the once near the blue/black line).<br>
Connect one side of the resistor where you put the wire before and the other side of the resistor in an arbitrarily decided center line.<br>
The LED has two legs:
1. the longer leg is positive
2. the shorter leg is negative
Connect the negative leg to the resistor (using the breadboard).<br>
Connet the positive leg to a wire that points to PIN 13.
**Please Note**: You can choose the pin you want, but you need to be sure to change the code accordingly.<br>

## Software requirement
1. Arduino IDE
   [click here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to download the IDE
2. PyCharm CE (or another Python IDE)
   [click here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to download the IDE

## Software setup
Arduino IDE offers a plenty of examples and firmare right inside it to facilitate development. For example, you can try to blink the LED on PIN 13:<br>
1. Press on `File`
2. `Examples`
3. `01.Basics`
4. `Blink`
Hit `Ctrl` + `U` to upload the code.<br>
First of all, you need to load a C script inside the board to allow Python code to be executed.<br>
So, in place of `Blink` example, let's load `StandardFirmata`:
1. Press on `File`
2. `Examples`
3. `Firmata`
4. `StandardFirmata`
Hit `Ctrl` + `U` to upload the code.
___
Open your favourite Python IDE, configure a *virtual environment* and add the *pyfirmata* library with the following line typed on the Terminal:<br>
`pip install pyfirmata`
