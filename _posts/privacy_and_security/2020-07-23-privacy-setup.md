## Introduction
In the 21st century, online security has become paramount! Most of us share on the internet a lot of information about themselves, like identity card number, date of birth, gender, phone number, home address and so on. Moreover, society like Google, Facebook and Amazon collect information on everything that concerns us, from purchasing behaviour to the time we spend on Instagram rather than on Facebook or LinkedIn: the so-called *big data*.<br><br>
It’s very important to keep in mind that **security** is not equal to **<**. Security whitout privacy is like having an unbreakable house made of glass. Inside you are safe (by means anyone can hurt you), but everyone can spy on you from outside.

## DuckDuckGo
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is the safest search engine that has ever been developed and the best alternative to [Google](https://google.com) since it doesn’t collect or share any of our personal information and does not store our search history. They’ve nothing to sell to advertisers that can track us across the Internet: let’s take a look to its [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy)!

## ProtonMail
Since the founding team met at CERN and created ProtonMail, Proton Technologies AG has grown into a global leader in online security. Today, they’re the world’s largest secure email provider with over one million users. The headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland, but it also has offices in San Francisco, CA, and Skopje, Macedonia.<br><br>
ProtonMail believes **privacy and security are universal values**. Inclusion and diversity are core company values. It is supported by more than 10,000 individuals from around the world who participated in their record-breaking crowdfunding campaign. Additional backers include [Charles River Ventures](https://www.crv.com/) and the Fondation Genevoise pour l’Innovation Technologique ([FONGIT](https://www.fongit.ch/)), a non-profit foundation financed by the [Swiss Federal Commission for Technology and Innovation](https://www.innosuisse.ch/inno/de/home.html) for the public good. They’re also advised by the [MIT Venture Mentoring Service](https://vms.mit.edu/).

## Firefox
Firefox, developed by Mozilla, is the third-most-popular browser on the Internet and it is open source. Its team has improved the browser’s privacy protections in recent years: they have introduced [advanced anti-fingerprinting](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/how-to-block-fingerprinting-with-firefox/) and [Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/control-trackers-with-firefox/) features in 2019, both of which make it much more difficult for third-party trackers to follow you around the Internet.<br><br>
It does not block advertisements by default, but you can download [ABP](https://adblockplus.org/)‘s extension (AdBlock Plus) or other similar extensions that will prevent advertisers from getting your information or showing you ads.<br><br>
Moreover, if you primarily browse the Internet on your mobile device, [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/#focus) incorporates automatic ad blocking: it was developed as an ad blocker for Safari, but was then transformed into a minimalistic privacy browser for Android!
