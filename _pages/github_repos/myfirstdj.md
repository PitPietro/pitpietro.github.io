This is my first project on Django framework and I want to share the knowledge I will accumulate by studing it. I followed [Corey Schafer's Django tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p) and I really enjoyed it!

## Discuss the project
I'll soon built a forum (maybe a Django blog) where we can discuss all the projects. For now, you could open a subreddit if you want. 

## Prerequisites

### Suggested virtual environment
I'll write you how to create the environment I am using.

### Suggested IDE
I suggest you to use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
