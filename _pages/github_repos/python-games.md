## Introduction
This repo is aimed to build games in all the possible ways.
<hr>

## Shell games
### Tic Tac Toe
The [tic-tac-toe.py](https://github.com/PitPietro/python-games/blob/master/shell-games/tic-tac-toe.py) uses `system os`
to get the terminal dimension and place the game in its center.
#### Run the script
Since `tic-tac-toe.py` is places in the sub-folder *shell-games*, if you open a terminal in the project, you'll first
need to run `cd shell-games/`, then you can run `python3 tic-tac-toe.py` Be sure to have given the script the ability to
run by typing `chmod -x tic-tac-toe.py`.
