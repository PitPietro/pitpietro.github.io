## History
CG (Computer Graphics) or CGI (Computer-generated imagery) is the discipline of generating images using computers. Today, it’s a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone, computer displays and so on. It’s a recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing.
<br><br>
CG includes user interface design, sprite graphics, rendering, ray tracing, geometry processing, computer animation, vector graphics, 3D modelling, shades, GPU design, implicit surface visualization, image processing, computational photography, scientific visualization, computational geometry, computer vision, etc, etc.
<br><br>
The sciences of geometry, optics, physics, and perception are preponderance for the study of Computer Graphics.

## Blender
Blender is a 3D computer graphics software tool-set used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, and computer games.
<br><br>
Blender’s features include 3D modelling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing. It has three render engine: Eevee, Workbench and Cycles.
<br><br>
**It is completely free and open-source!**

This is one of the most important points in its favour, I’ll really enjoy share my projects and my knowledge. I am a newbie and I’ll do my best to came up whit stunning projects so keep on moving!
