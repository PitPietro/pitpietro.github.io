I started programming in C and Java at high schools, then in Kotlin for Android development. I learned PHP and MySQL to understand the client-server interaction. Moreover, I’m studying C#, Delphi and Python to enhance my programming flexibility.

I’m very interested in online security, as technology has become increasingly invasive in our private lives!

During the lockdown I had my first working experience. It was quite hard to balance the work and the last year of high school, but I did my best and I gained a lot of soft skills knowledge.

I am also a sports addicted and I love everything about movement in general: I travel 10 km by bike every day to get to and from school instead of taking a couple of buses to cross the city. I have played basketball for a few years, then I did competitive swimming together with parkour (strictly outdoors), running race at an amateur level, water polo and now I’m practicing tricking (acrobatic martial arts). I love skiing and snorkeling too!
