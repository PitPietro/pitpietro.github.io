      </div>
      <p class="text-justify">Computer programming is the process of designing and building a program for performing a specific computing task. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task on a computer, usually for solving a given problem.
        <i>Software engineering</i> combines engineering techniques with software development practices. <i>Reverse engineering</i> is the opposite process.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        There are different languages you can start whit, but the most important thing to keep in mind is the mental structure useful for facing and solving problems through programming. It is not important the language you talk, but the correctness with which you speak it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        A strong strategy is essential to avoid the so called <i>spaghetti code</i> and ensure an easy code maintenance. Otherwise, you’ll run into the following problems:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rigidity<br>The difficulty in modifying the code and unknown development times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fragility<br>The tendency to malfunction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immobility<br>When parts of non-reusable code lead to duplication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Viscosity<br>When a change leads to several changes.
          </li>
        </ol>
        To avoid those promlems, it's foundamental to implement the following paradigms and advice.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-center" id="six-p">The 6 pillars</h2>
      <h4 id="oop">Object Orientated Programming</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        OOP stands for Object Orientated Programming. The Object Orientated paradigm is widely diffuse in all the most modern programming languages. C or Pascal doesn’t implement it, while Java, C++, C#, Object Pascal and even PHP do. This paradigm implies:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Encapsulation<br>It hides how a class does its business, while allows other classes to make requests to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abstraction & Generalizations<br>Abstraction places the emphasis on what an object is (or does) rather then how it’s represent or how it works. Generalizations reduces complexity by replacing multiple entities which perform similar functions with a single construct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inheritance<br>It’s the ability of a class to extend another existing class (the so called super-class). A class can extend the functionality of it’s super-class by adding new types and method and by overriding existing ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            Polymorphism<br>It’s the capability to perform the same operations by a wide range of different types of things. In OOP it’s achieved by:
            <ol>
              <li>
                overloading<br>The same method can be written multiple times whit different parameters in the same class.
              </li>
              <li>
                overriding<br>A method inherited by a super class is modified by the extending class.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h4 id="sc">Source Control</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. The SCM (Source Control Management) provides a history of code and resolves conflicts during the merge of code from multiple contributors.
      </p>
      <h5>Git</h5>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Git is an open-source distributed source code management system. Git allows you to create a copy of your repository (branch). Using this branch, you can then work on your code independently from the stable version of your codebase. Once you are ready with your changes, you can store them as a set of differences (commit). You can pull in commits from other contributors to your repository, push your commits to others, and merge your commits back into the main version of the repository.
      </p>
      <h4 id="dp">Design Patterns</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <a href="design-pattern/dp-index.html">Design Patterns</a> are reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems. They are <i>half cooked</i>, which means that they aren’t really a <i>code</i> solution, but you will achieve it by using the logic behind the design pattern. The 23 main patterns are subdivided in three categories: <b>Creatonal</b>, <b>Structural</b> and <b>Behavioral</b>. I dedicated to them an entire page of my blog to avoid make this page too much confused.
      </p>
      <h4 id="nc">Naming Convention</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Naming conventions are mainly used in team software development, one of their purposes is simplify code readability but it’s very difficult to find a suitable naming convention so I’ll talk about mainly theoretically, whit some examples too.
      </p>
      <h4 id="ut">Unit test</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        It’s a level of software testing where individual units (components) of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one (or a few inputs) and usually a single output. In OOP, the smallest unit is a method. Unit testing frameworks, drivers, stubs, and mock/ fake objects are used to assist in unit testing.
      </p>
      <h4 id="sbt">set-based thinking</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        It is an approach which lets specify <i>what to do</i>, but does not let to specify <i>how to do</i>.
